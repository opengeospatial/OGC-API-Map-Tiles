# OGC API - Maps

This GitHub repository contains the draft OGC API - Maps specification that defines a Web API for requesting map images over the Internet. OGC API - Maps makes it easy for a client to request images, changing parameters such as size and coordinate reference systems at the time of request. A server that implements OGC API - Maps provides information about what maps it offers, as well as producing a map and answering queries about the content of the maps. OGC API - Maps is expected to address use cases similar to those addressed by the Web Map Service (WMS) standard.

## Relation to other OGC standards and previous works

OGC API - Maps follows on the footsteps of the [OGC](http://opengeospatial.org)'s Web Map Service (WMS) by enabling client applications to request maps of geospatial information on the web. However, OGC API - Maps is completely different from WMS, as OGC API - Maps focuses on a simple RESTful core specified as reusable [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org) components.

This is the CURRENT working version of this initiative (Old version work has been moved to the deliverables in Testbed-15 that contain the LAST VERSION of the materials. See: https://github.com/opengeospatial/T-15-D014-WMTS_draft_specification)

IMPORTANT: Some examples of OpenAPI documents that are used as inspiration and test of this work are at: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/UAB-CREAF

The OGC API - Maps and [OGC API - Tiles](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Tiles) specifications are closely related and should be considered complementary.

## Standards
After a while getting familiar and playing with the OpenAPI definition files (explained just below in the "Examples section"), we have finally started to write the standard. We have decided on an aggressive path towards a modular specification with a simple core and multiple extensions. The extensions are yet to be determined.

The standard is written using asciidoc using many files that might be difficult to trace. Please see the standard document as a single HTML page that is EASY TO READ here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Maps/blob/master/core/standard/OAPI_Maps.html

We received several recommendations to separate the specifications into a core and extensions. In March 2020, we decided to restructure the GitHub repository to separate the core and the extensions into different documents that might be elaborated at different speeds.

At this moment in time we are working on doing this separation by moving files around.

#### OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core
The definition of the maps core is the immediate next step that will be done [here: clause_8_map_core](core/standard/clause_8_map_core.adoc).

The maps core would be something that allows to create a map that cannot be necessarily retrievable (yet). The reason: We need to support /maps/{styleID}/tiles/…
* It has no resolution
** No parameters related to width, height, bbox, crs… etc.
* Actually, it is a map that can only be retrieved by extending it to (one of):
** a tile
** a map+resolution
* It will not have styles (because this forces a dependency to the styles API that I would like to avoid): {styleID}=“default”.

#### Extensions
We foresee the following extensions (some of them may eventually become OGC standards and others might not).
None of them has been started yet.

* StyleIds (Pending. In collaboration with the styles API. The only one necessary for the delta updates use cases)
* Map+resolution
* Info
* Collections (more than one)
* Collections-info
* Maps with styles on the fly (involving collections)

## Examples

WARNING: This section needs to be updated.

Until mid July 2019, the work was focused on providing OpenAPI services description examples and domains (libraries). Now we believe this work is finalized, but each time that we take a look we still find gaps, mistakes and things that can be improved.
We expect that during the effort of extracting the knowledge accumulated (hopefully) in these files to create the standard, we will keep fixing, perfecting and evolving things.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are now using the Swagger HUB again and the following should be considered the "gold copy". The Swagger account is:
* [Domain documents](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search?owner=UAB-CREAF&type=DOMAIN)
* [API example documents](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search?owner=UAB-CREAF&type=API)

The material in the [standards folder](core/standard/openapi) takes precedence to the text of the standard and the Swagger HUB takes precedence to the material in GitHub. The [standards folder](core/standard/openapi) examples are intended to be identical to the Swagger HUB ones except for the path names. To go from  Swagger HUB to GitHub do the following substitutions:
* Replace "https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-" with "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Maps/master/standard/openapi/ogc-api-"
* Replace "/1.0.0#/" by ".yaml#/"

The files in the [standards folder](core/standard/openapi) are structured in several parts that can be combined together.

A [OGC API maps and tiles OPF FULL example in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-map-tiles-opf-xmp-full/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-map-tiles-opf-xmp-full.yaml) that contains full example of server with some features and coverages that are served as maps and/or tiles.

The latter is normally too long to be analyzed. The following are easier to understand.

Examples:
* A [OGC API OPF example for vector tiles in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-tiles-opf-xmp-vt-more-1-collection/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-tiles-opf-xmp-vt-more-1-collection.yaml) that describes a service that can serve only tiled features (vector tiles) of one or more collections.
* A [OGC API OPF example for tiled map in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-map-tiles-opf-xmp-mt-more-1-collection/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-map-tiles-opf-xmp-mt-more-1-collection.yaml) that describes a service that can serve only map (raster) tiles of one or more collections.
* A [OGC API OPF example for maps in Swagger](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-maps-opf-xmp-ore-1-collection.yaml) that describes a service that can serve only maps of one or more collections.
* A [OGC API OPF example for tiled coverages in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-tiles-opf-xmp-vt-more-1-collection/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-tiles-opf-xmp-vt-more-1-collection.yaml) that describes a service that can serve tiled coverages of one or more collections. This example was not initially needed by the sponsors but is motivated by the elevation map in a GeoPackage example.

Libraries:
* A [OGC API common DOMAIN document in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-common/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-common.yaml). It contains fragments that can be reference in api document instances or other domain document. It could become part of a future OGC API common standard additional material.
* A [OGC API maps DOMAIN document in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-maps/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-maps.yaml). It contains fragments that can be reference in api document instances or other domain document. It could become part of a future OGC API maps standard additional material.
* A [OGC API maps and tiles DOMAIN document in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-map-tiles/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-map-tiles.yaml). It contains fragments that can be reference in api document instances or other domain document. It will be included by OGC API maps standard and tiles standard.
* A [OGC API tiles DOMAIN document in Swagger](https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/UAB-CREAF/ogc-api-tiles/1.0.0) or in [GitHub](core/standard/openapi/ogc-api-tiles.yaml). It contains fragments that can be reference in api document instances or other domain document. It could become part of a future OGC API tiles standard additional material.

## Overview

IMPORTANT NOTE: The description in this README.md can be older than the one in the [standard](core/standard) draft. In case of discrepancy the standard draft takes precedence.

### Maps

A "OGC API - Maps" is a standard API that provides maps representing geospatial data.

```
GET /.../.../map/{styleId}
```

The identifier of the "layer" is replaced by "{collectionId}" or "coverage"...

Maps can be requested in any available CRS and can be subset by bbox width and height (and eventually other parameters such as time and elevation)
```
GET /.../.../map/{styleId}?crs=CRS84&bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89&width=600&height=400
```
Returns a map - a representation of real-world elements at a given resolution. {styleId} is optional.

## Using the standard

Those who want to just see the endpoints and responses can explore generic
OpenAPI definitions in this folder (please paste one of them in the Swagger Editor):

* [OGC-API-Maps/openapi/](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Maps/tree/master/openapi)

Several implementations of the draft standard exist:

== Scope

This draft specification specifies how to access maps and tiles in a manner independent of the underlying data store. The standard makes use of the https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI] specification and specifies resources for discovery, retrieval and querying of maps from a Web API.

Specifically, this draft OGC API - Maps specification supports the following:

* Discovery operations allow the API to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and to retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of maps. This includes the API definition as well as metadata about the map layers provided through the API and the Coordinate Reference Systems supported by the API.
* Retrieval operations that allow a client application to get a map from the API
* Query operations that allow a client application to retrieve data (e.g. feature attributes) at a point on a map

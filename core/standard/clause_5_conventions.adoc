=== Link relations

To express relationships between resources, <<rfc8288,RFC 8288 (Web Linking)>> is used.

The following <<link-relations,registered link relation types [IANA]>> are used in this document.

* **collection**: The target IRI points to a resource which represents the collection resource for the context IRI.

* **describedby**: Refers to a resource providing information about the link's context.

* **next**: Indicates that the link's context is a part of a series, and that the next in the series is the link target.

* **license**: Refers to a license associated with this context.

* **prev**: Indicates that the link's context is a part of a series, and that the previous in the series is the link target.

** This relation is only used in examples.

* **self**: Conveys an identifier for the link's context.

* **service-desc**: Identifies service description for the context that is primarily intended for consumption by machines.

** API definitions are considered service descriptions.

* **service-doc**: Identifies service documentation for the context that is primarily intended for human consumption.

In addition the following link relation types are used for which no applicable registered link relation type could be identified.

* **items**: Refers to a resource that is comprised of members of the collection represented by the link's context.

* **conformance**: Refers to a resource that identifies the specifications that the link's context conforms to.

Each resource representation includes an array of links. Implementations are free to add additional links for all resources provided by the API.
